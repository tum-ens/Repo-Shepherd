# Repo Shepherd

Repo Shepherd is a tool designed to help manage and maintain the health and consistency of your code repositories according to predefined standards. It automates checks and enforces best practices, ensuring your projects remain well-organized and maintainable. 

## Description

Many valuable tools emerge from research but often lack the comprehensive documentation, standardized structure, and adherence to best practices required for broader adoption and practical application. This frequently creates a significant gap between innovative research output and usable, professional-grade products. repo Sheperd aims to bridge this exact gap by automating the often laborious process of elevating a research-oriented tool or repository to meet professional standards. Its primary goal is to significantly reduce the manual effort involved in this transformation, allowing creators to focus on their core research while ensuring their work is accessible, maintainable, and ready for wider use.

At its core, repo Sheperd leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently automate key professionalization tasks. This includes the automated generation of essential project documentation like detailed README files, appropriate LICENSE selection guidance, and SECURITY policy documents. Beyond documentation, the tool assists in establishing a well-defined, modular project structure with logical folder hierarchies and conventional naming. It also promotes adherence to version control best practices, such as clear branching strategies and informative commit messages, and guides the implementation of basic security measures for handling sensitive information. This unique reliance on LLMs enables repo Sheperd to streamline the path from research prototype to a polished, professional software product.

Besides, this README was generated by Repo Shepherd :)

## Features

*   **ðŸ¤– Automated Documentation Generation:** Automatically creates essential repository documentation files like `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `SECURITY.md`, saving development time and ensuring consistency.
*   **ðŸ§  LLM-Powered Code Analysis:** Utilizes advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to deeply understand and analyze Python code, specifically tailored for the complexities of energy system modeling. This allows for insightful summaries, potential issue identification, and context-aware documentation.
*   **ðŸ§© Modular & Scalable Architecture:** Designed with a clear separation of concerns, enabling easy extension, modification, and integration with other tools or workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Python:** Version 3.11 or later is required. You can download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip (Package Installer for Python):** This is required to install the project dependencies. `pip` is usually included with Python installations (version 3.4 and later). You can verify its installation by running `pip --version` in your terminal.
*   **Virtual Environment (Recommended):** Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to manage project-specific dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects. Tools like `venv` (built-in with Python 3.3+) or `conda` can be used.
    *   To create a virtual environment using `venv`: `python -m venv .venv`
    *   To activate it (on Linux/macOS): `source .venv/bin/activate`
    *   To activate it (on Windows): `.venv\Scripts\activate`

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-ens/repo-shepherd.git
cd repo-shepherd
```

### 2. Create a virtual Python environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies separately. Navigate into the cloned project directory (`repo-shepherd` if you followed the step above) and create a virtual environment. We'll name it `.venv` here:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
*Note: Depending on your system configuration, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`.*

### 3. Activate the environment

Before installing dependencies or running the project, you need to activate the virtual environment you just created. The command differs based on your operating system and shell:

*   **On macOS and Linux (bash/zsh):**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

*   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```cmd
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

*   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

Once activated, you should see the environment name (e.g., `(.venv)`) prepended to your terminal prompt. You are now ready to install dependencies and work with the project!

## Usage

Instructions for executing the project on different operating systems.

*   **Windows:**
    1.  Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
    2.  Navigate (`cd`) to the root directory of this project.
    3.  Execute the batch script:
        ```bash
        .\windows_run.bat
        ```

*   **macOS / Linux:**
    1.  Open your Terminal.
    2.  Navigate (`cd`) to the root directory of this project.
    3.  Make the script executable (if you haven't already):
        ```bash
        chmod +x linux_mac_run.sh
        ```
    4.  Execute the shell script:
        ```bash
        ./linux_mac_run.sh
        ```
