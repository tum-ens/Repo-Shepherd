Left Frame: Sections Button
---------------------------

You can choose which sections you want to include in your README.

This tool provides templates for the following sections: **Title**, **Description**, **Feature**, **Requirement**, **Installation**, **Usage**, **Contact**, and **License**.

**Title**:  
Enter the name of your repository.

**Description**:  
Provide a brief description of the repository. You can also enter a few words or phrases to describe its purpose.

**Feature**:  
List the key features of your repository.  
If you're unsure what to write, click **Generate** to let the LLM create a draft for you.  
You can also add or remove fields in this popup.

**Requirement**:  
List the required software or dependencies (e.g., `gurobi`).

**Installation**:  
Specify the required IDE, package manager, Git address, and any other installation instructions.

**Usage**:  
Explain how to run or use the program.

**Contact**:  
Provide your name, email address, and personal website (if applicable).

**License**:  
Choose one license from the following options:
- MIT License  
- GNU License  
- Apache License


Left Frame: File Management Buttons
-----------------------------------

**Repo**: Generates a file tree to help the LLM understand the structure of your repository.  
You can control the depth of the file tree and choose whether only folder names are included.

**Export**: Once you have refined and saved all sections, you can export the complete README.  
The LLM will compose all the refined sections into a valid Markdown README file.  
After generation, a popup will ask where to save the new file.  
In the popup, you can also rearrange the order of the sections.

Left Frame: Navigation Buttons
------------------------------

**Help**: Displays simple instructions for using this tab.

**Back**: Returns to the main tab.


Right Frame: Suggestions
------------------------

This frame displays the LLM-refined version of the README section.

You can edit the suggestion manually.  
Don't worry about formattingâ€”the **Export** function will let the LLM compile all refined sections into a well-formatted Markdown README.

**Generate**: Use the LLM to refine the selected section.

**Save**: Save the refined section if you are satisfied with the result.
