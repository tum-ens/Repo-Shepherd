**Explanation:**

* **`dhmin/` directory:** This is the top-level directory of the project.
* **`src/dhmin/` package:** The source code for the `dhmin` library is placed inside a structured package.  Critically, this makes it easier to import modules from `dhmin` within other Python files.
    * `__init__.py`: Initializes the `dhmin` package; empty for basic package declaration.
    * `dhmin.py`: Contains the core `DHMIN` model.
    * `dhmintools.py`: Contains helper functions for the model, as in the original structure.
* **`tests/` directory:** The directory for unit tests, including test files that test `dhmin.py` and `dhmintools.py` separately.
* **`docs/` directory:** The directory where the Sphinx documentation is built.
* **`.gitignore`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`:** Standard files for a Python package, managing version control, documentation, licenses, installation procedures, and the project itself.

**Additional Improvements:**

* **Modular Design:** The use of `dhmin/` as a package fosters a better modular design.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** The addition of separate test files for `dhmin.py` and `dhmintools.py` ensures independent unit testing.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The separation of `dhmin` model implementation from helper functions in `dhmintools.py` enhances code maintainability.

**How to use:**

The improved structure enables clean import statements:

```python
import dhmin
import dhmintools
#...
```


This structure effectively organizes the codebase for a Python library, ensuring better modularity, maintainability, and testability of `dhmin` (the model) and `dhmintools`.  You would then organize your `rundh.py` and `rundhshp.py` files to utilize the `dhmin` module for model creation and use.  Additionally, the `src` directory is part of the package, as opposed to being at the top level.  Finally, the added structure makes the development and maintenance of `dhmin` significantly easier.
